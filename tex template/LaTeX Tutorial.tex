%%%% LaTeX basics
\LaTeX \ has odd spacing.

if you write a line
and continue on the next one, you might notice a problem

if you write a line and something else \\
and continue on the next one, you might notice it's fixed, sort of? \\
what if...
hmmmmm

now?








how about now?











where are my spaces?

i guess i only need one...


%% vertical spacing
\vspace{60pt} 

i could do this though

%% centering
\begin{center}
i can write in the middle
\end{center}

\begin{flushright}
or over here to write my name and student ID in the top right corner
\end{flushright}

% \textbf{string s}
this is normal text, \textbf{but this is bolded.}

% \textit{} or \emph{}
this is normal text, \textit{this is italicized}, and \emph{this is emphasized}


\vspace{36pt}

% \texttt{} 
this is normal text, \texttt{and this is cool math-ish pc-looking text}

% sizing
{\large this is large} 
{\Large this is Large}
{\small or you can be small}
{\tiny or even tiny}

\vspace{1in}


%% Spacing
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%% horizontal spacing
% in pt (points/pixels? not sure tbh)
\hspace{200pt} over here


% or inches:
\hspace{2in} weeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

% causes the error below of "Overfull \hbox":
\hspace{7in} weeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

% for some reason this one isn't an error...
\hspace{-1.5in} weeeeeeeeeeeeeeee


	% the re-sizing is based on the math engine, but it can
	% also tell what height your letters are.
